ðŸ“‹ To-Do List Web Application
This project is a simple yet powerful To-Do List Web Application built with Streamlit. The app allows users to add tasks with status labels (Not Started, In Progress, Completed), mark tasks as complete using intuitive checkboxes (which apply a strikethrough for visual feedback), edit task details, and delete tasks. All task data is managed in memory using Streamlit's session state, enabling a smooth interactive experience without needing a backend database. This project is perfect for learning Streamlit basics, practicing Python web app development, or creating your own productivity tool.
